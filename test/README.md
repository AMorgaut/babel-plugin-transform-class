# transform-class plugin tests

# Test Runner

Those tests are run using the mechanism proposed by [`generator-babel-plugin`](https://github.com/thejameskyle/generator-babel-plugin)

`npm test` launches the command `mocha --compilers js:babel-register`

# Test Cases

The `fixtures` folder includes:

* The example shown in the main README file
* Some "spec" test cases coming from the `transform-es2015-classes` plugin proposed by default and maintained by the Babel team.
